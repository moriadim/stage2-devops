# Backend.im Deployment - Research Notes

Just thinking through how to set up a deployment flow for Backend.im using mostly free tools. The goal is to make it so a dev can push code and have it live without dealing with a bunch of manual steps.

## The Basic Idea

So the flow would be something like:
1. Developer pushes code to github
2. GitHub Actions kicks in, builds a docker image
3. Image gets pushed to a registry (like Docker Hub)
4. Backend.im pulls the image and runs it
5. Done

The trick is that Backend.im probably has an API we can call. We just need a simple wrapper to make it easier.

## Tools I'd Use

Looking at free options here:

**GitHub** - Already where most people keep code. Free for public repos. Plus it has GitHub Actions built in which handles CI/CD.

**Docker Hub** - Free tier is fine for this. Could use GitHub Container Registry too since it's built in and also free.

**Python or Bash** - For the CLI wrapper. Just something simple that calls Backend.im's API.

That's pretty much it. No need for anything fancy.

## How It Would Work

Developer does:
```bash
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions workflow runs:
- Builds docker image
- Runs tests (if any)
- Pushes to registry
- Calls Backend.im API to deploy

The workflow file would be maybe 40-50 lines of YAML. Standard stuff.

For a CLI tool, you'd have a simple script that wraps the API calls:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import sys

def deploy(image, api_key):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.backend.im/v1/deployments",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
        json={"image": image}
    )
    print(f"Deployed: {response.json()['url']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deploy(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

That's like 15 lines. Super simple.

## The Flow

```
Developer pushes code
    ↓
GitHub repo
    ↓
GitHub Actions triggered
    ↓
Build docker image
    ↓
Push to Docker Hub
    ↓
Call Backend.im API to deploy
    ↓
Done - app is live
```

## Minimal Code Needed

1. GitHub Actions workflow - standard YAML, maybe 40 lines
2. CLI wrapper script - Python or bash, 50 lines max
3. Dockerfile if they don't have one - 10 lines

Total: maybe 100 lines of code. Not much.

## Costs

For public repos: $0. Everything is free.
For private repos: GitHub Pro is like $4/month, Docker Hub has a paid tier but the free one might be enough.

So basically free if the repo is public.

## Security Stuff

- Keep API keys in GitHub Secrets, not in the repo
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Maybe scan images before deploying (optional)

## Alternatives I Looked At

Could use GitLab instead of GitHub. Has built-in registry. But GitHub is more common.

Could self-host everything. Would need a server. More control but also more work.

Could use AWS stuff. Costs money though.

Picked GitHub + Docker Hub because it's simple and free.

## Claude Integration

With Claude Code CLI, you'd just tell it:
"I want to deploy my app to Backend.im"

And it would:
- Check if you have a Dockerfile (create one if not)
- Check if you have CI/CD setup (create GitHub Actions workflow if not)
- Create the CLI wrapper script
- Add environment variables to .env.example
- Write a quick README

All automatic. Pretty nice.

## What's Still Needed

Need to actually research the Backend.im API if it's not documented. Probably just REST endpoints. Standard stuff.

Once you know the API, the wrapper script is trivial to write.

The GitHub Actions workflow is also pretty standard. Lots of examples online for deploying docker images.

## Takeaways

This setup would be:
- Free (for public repos)
- Simple (couple config files)
- Automated (push and it deploys)
- Uses common tools (GitHub, Docker, etc.)

The main insight is that Backend.im probably already has a REST API. You just need a thin wrapper to make it easier to use, plus the CI/CD to automate the build and deploy steps.

Total effort: Maybe an hour to set up, half of that researching their API. After that it's just push and deploy.
